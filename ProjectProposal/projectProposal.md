National Parks Data Project
Team Members: Paul Brichta, Lindsey Wolterstorff, and Sam Holland

Visitation numbers will be embedded in the main map, data found here:
Visitation Statistics - Social Science (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)

Create a map with geojson boundaries of each park from the above nps boundary data link. 
-	Event handler for clicks: Show park properties like name, visitation numbers, etc.

-	Webpage will have a table below the map with articles, images, tweets, links, description, etc.
    - API for articles: https://newsapi.org/
